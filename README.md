## Git vs. GitHub
Git is the code for your project and GitHub is a website where you can share your projects and code.

## Initial Setup
You can set up your GitHub account by entering your email and making a password. You can now share your projects from your CS50 IDE to GitHub for others to see.

Then, you go into the file and touch README.md to make the readme file After, you git init, git commit, git remote add, and git push. You can see the readme on the github page.

## Workflow & Commands
A workflow is the process of making changes to something then pushing it to github in order for other people to see those changes.
After you have made the changes you want use Git add to tell git you are ready so commit the changes you made
Then git commit to save the changes you made and git init to initialize your new github repository that you just made.
Lastly you git push in order to push your new version to github.
